# EEG-data-practice

The notebook in the "EEG-data-practice" repository provides a step-by-step workflow for processing EEG data. It includes sections on loading EEG datasets, data cleaning, feature extraction, and building machine learning models for classification. The focus seems to be on preprocessing raw EEG signals, handling artifacts, and applying machine learning techniques to enhance predictive performance.
